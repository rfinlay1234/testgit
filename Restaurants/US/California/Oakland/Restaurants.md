La Furia Chalaca - Peruvian
Delicious and reasonably priced Peruvian food. The cuisine comes from the northern coast of Peru, and is a pleasant combination of seafood and the vegetable ingredients normally associated with South American dishes. Try the Ceviche, which the menu describes as: "Seasoned fish and shellfish marinated in lime juice with a touch of chili. Served with corn, yuca and sweet potatoes."
